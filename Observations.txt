1.Age Distribution Histogram
Observation:
The majority of passengers are between ages 20 and 40. There are fewer children and elderly passengers on board.

2.Fare Distribution by Passenger Class (Boxplot)
Observation:
Passengers in 1st class paid significantly higher fares than those in 2nd and 3rd class. Some outliers in each class paid exceptionally high fares.

3.Scatterplot of Age vs Fare colored by Survival
Observation:
Survivors appear more among younger passengers and those who paid higher fares, suggesting age and fare may influence survival chances.

4.Pairplot of Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived
Observation:
The pairplot confirms that survivors are more common in higher passenger classes (Pclass=1) and tend to pay higher fares. Age and Fare also show some separation between survivors and non-survivors.

5.Correlation Heatmap
Observation:
There is a strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare, as lower class numbers represent higher classes with higher fares. Survival correlates positively with Fare and negatively with Pclass.

6.Countplot of Survival by Sex
Observation:
Females have a higher survival rate compared to males, indicating gender played an important role in survival.
